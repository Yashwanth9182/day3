        It defines the content and structure of web content <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content"> web
            content</a> . It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Cascading Style Sheets</a> scripting languages <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language"> sriping languages</a> such as <a

    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML elements</a> are the building blocks of HTML pages.
        With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as <a href=""> interactive forms</a> may be embedded into
        the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
        text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
        written using Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and
        provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"> Browsers</a> do not display the HTML tags but use them to
        interpret the content of the page</p>

    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium"> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) </a>, former
        maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
        presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">
            HTML5</a>, is used to display video and audio primarily using the element together with JavaScript.</p>
